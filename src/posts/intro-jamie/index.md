I’m looking forward to starting on my work to add new exciting features to VirtualShip including biogeochemical sampling techniques!

I did my PhD at the University of Exeter in the UK where I worked on seasonal forecasting of the European North-West shelf seas. Prior to this I worked on mesoscale oceanography (eddies) physical-biogeochemical extreme events.
