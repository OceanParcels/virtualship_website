We are excited to announce the launch of the new front-facing website for the VirtualShip project!

The new website is designed to be more user-friendly and visually appealing, with a focus on providing clear information and updates about the project and its goals.

The website design follows that of [oceanparcels.org](https://oceanparcels.org) and is based on the excellent [Xarray website](https://xarray.dev). Thank you to the Xarray team for their work here and their continued work on the Xarray project!
